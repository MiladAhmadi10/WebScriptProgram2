                <h1>Milad Ahmadi </h1>
                <p>I am an Ontario Tech University student studying Networking and IT Security. I am currently enrolled in my second year of my program which I am looking forward to continue striving in. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, I also enjoy learning new things especially new things that can help me earn money. One example of one of these new things I like to learn about is Day Trading, I recently got into Day Trading as I have been interested in this for quite a long time. Im still learning about this field and I hope soon I can become a profitable trader.</p>
                <p>Get to know me a bit more!</p>

                <h2>Encryption Decipher Tool <img src="/images/python.png" height="50", width="50"/></h2>
                <p>A couple of mates and I created a program which can decipher any type of encryption code, me and my group mates each got a clear understanding of how encryptions work and how to easily decipher encryptions. This program was made using python and lead to a better understanding of how the language works </p1>

                <h2>CryptoMine Network <img src = "/images/cisco.png" height="50", width="70"/></h2>
                <p>In this project we developed a strategic routing protocol that allows a company that goes by the name of CryptoMine to be able to communcate with its other locations, these locations included Toronto, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York. Due to the different protocols that we used such as OSPF and BGP, this allowed for CryptoMine to be connected to each seperate location. </p2>
